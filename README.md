## PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW

1. Analysis section

I have used both SPSS, STATA and R as primary tools for data analysis.
Currently i prefer R because it is open source and very easy to extend by writing your own functions, connect to a number of data sources and great visualization libraries to choose from.


2. Dashboards

I started building dashboards using PHP which were very limited. I then moved to Rshiny which is great but also has its challenges. Recently I have used metabase and PowerBi and i think setting them up and running requires less time compared to the others. This area is big and every company has their own choices. Currently I prefer PowerBI for my dashboards.


3. ETLs

I can comfortably write ETL workflows using python. I rely mostly on python clients for the various data sources(which in many cases exist) when pulling data using APIs.
I have done ETLs in R too but i generally prefer python over R because of speed and high number of developers use python therefore your pipelines maintenance will not be limited to R developers only.
